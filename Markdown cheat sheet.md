# Introduction

Markdown is a way to write content for the web. It is written in what people like to call plaintext, which is exactly the sort of text youâ€™re used to writing and seeing. Plaintext is just the regular alphabet, with a few familiar symbols, like asterisks ( * ) and backticks ( ` ).

Links are used to refer to a website or a header.
And there are two types of link:

- Inline link: refer to a website or header in directly in the tag.

## Embeded object*

**important notice:** It is possible to embed an image or html file into markdown file. But it is not recommended, because it is not supported everywhere.
Like:

<img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAUAAAAFCAYAAACNbyblAAAAHElEQVQI12P4//8/w38GIAXDIBKE0DHxgljNBAAO9TXL0Y4OHwAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==" alt="Red dot" />

## Blockquotes

A blockquote is a sentence or paragraph that's been specially formatted to draw attention to the reader. Which also can be styled and contain IMG and LINK. For example:

### Single paragraph

>"The sin of __doing nothing__ is the **deadliest** of all the seven sins. It has been said that for evil men to accomplish their purpose it is only necessary that good men should do nothing."

### Multiple paragraphs

>In order to group multiple paragraph into one quotes you can use the symbol ( > ):
>
> - in the blank lines between the paragraphs
>
>- and at the start of each paragraph
