# Introduction

Markdown is a way to write content for the web. It is written in what people like to call plaintext, which is exactly the sort of text youâ€™re used to writing and seeing. Plaintext is just the regular alphabet, with a few familiar symbols, like asterisks ( * ) and backticks ( ` ).

## headers

There are six levels of header with decreasing size, Which also can be styled with _italic_ *text*.

```markdown
# Header *one*
## Header *two*
### Header *three*
#### Header *four*
##### Header *five*
###### Header *six*
```

## Style text

You can style almost **anywhere** in text as an:

- italc text using a _single underscore_ or a *single asterisk*.
  - (`*text*`), (`_text_`)
- bold text using a  __double underscore__ or a **double asterisk**.
  - (`__text__`), (`**text**`)
- **_both at the same time_**.
  - (`**_text_**`), (`__*text*__`)

## Links

Links are used to refer to a website or a header.
And there are two types of link:

- [Inline link](#inline-link): refer to a website or header in directly in the tag.
- [Reference link](#reference-link): refer to a website or header using a defind variable in the document.

There are two types of links:

- link to a website.
  - `https://www.google.com`
- link to an anchor/header in the document.
  - `#links`
  
### Inline link

```markdown
[text](#links)
```  

You can make a link to a website [within the sentence](www.google.com).

or redirect to a [section](#Reference-link) in the current document.

### Reference link

```markdown
[a link to github][link].
[link]: www.github.com
```

with **Reference link** you can define the link anywhere in the document and use it when you need it. For example: Here's [a link to github][link]

[link]: www.github.com

## Images

Images are similar to links. with the only defference being that image are prefaced with an exclamation point ( ! ), and the **optional** text is used as an alternative text for the image when it is not accessible.

There are two types of images:

- [Inline image](#inline-image)
- [Reference image](#reference-image)

Link to images comes in two forms :

- local image
  - `images/image.png`
- image from the Internet
  - `https://duckduckgo.com/assets/common/dax-logo.svg`

### Inline image

```markdown
![tiger](images/Tiger.jpg)
```

![link](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Tiger.50.jpg)

## Embeded object*

```markdown
<img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAUAAAAFCAYAAACNbyblAAAAHElEQVQI12P4//8/w38GIAXDIBKE0DHxgljNBAAO9TXL0Y4OHwAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==" alt="Red dot" />
```

**important notice:** It is possible to embed an image or html file into markdown file. But it is not recommended, because it is not supported everywhere.

<img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAUAAAAFCAYAAACNbyblAAAAHElEQVQI12P4//8/w38GIAXDIBKE0DHxgljNBAAO9TXL0Y4OHwAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==" alt="Red dot" />

this red cricle is an embeded object

## Blockquotes

```markdown
> first line
> 
> third line
```

A blockquote is a sentence or paragraph that's been specially formatted to draw attention to the reader. Which also can be styled and contain IMG and LINK. For example:

- Single paragraph

  > Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nam maximus leo vitae orci finibus sagittis. Ut feugiat augue eget ante interdum, nec porttitor nunc feugiat. Nam ut sapien a libero consequat venenatis eu a nulla. Etiam gravida scelerisque nisl. Etiam pretium tempus nisi ac congue.

- Multiple paragraphs

  >In order to group multiple paragraph into one quotes you can use the symbol (`>`):
  >
  >- in the blank lines between the paragraphs
  >
  >- and at the start of each paragraph
  >
  > See, that was easy

## list

List are made using - or * interchangeably.

And can be styled with both italic and bold. It's also possible to use a link or even an image.

There are two types of lists (order list & unordered list).

You can nest a list as far as you want.

### Ordered list

1. Step one
2. Step two
3. Step three

### Unordered list

- Chicken
- Egg
- Bread
- Milk
- Dates

### Nested list

#### Example 1

1. Calculus
    - A professor
    - Has no hair
    - Often wears green
      1. Has a modern style in clothes
         - Wear a Jacket
2. Castafiore
    - An opera singer
    - Has white hair
    - Is possibly mentally unwell

#### Example 2

1. Crack three eggs over a bowl.

    Now, you're going to want to crack the eggs in such a way that you don't make a mess.

    If you _do_ make a mess, use a towel to clean it up!

2. Pour a gallon of milk into the bowl.

    Basically, take the same guidance as above: don't be messy, but if you are, clean it up!

3. Rub the salmon vigorously with butter.

   By "vigorous," we mean a strictly vertical motion. Julia Child once quipped:

   > Up and down and all around, that's how butter on salmon goes.

4. Drop the salmon into the egg-milk bowl.

   Here are some techniques on salmon-dropping:

   - Make sure no trout or children are present
   - Use both hands
   - Always have a towel nearby in case of messes

#### Example 3

- *Cat*

## Paragraphs

You can add a new line in a paragraph  
by adding two spaces at the end of each line.

And here is a new paragraph wich is surrounded by blank spaces to seprate it from the other paragraphs.
